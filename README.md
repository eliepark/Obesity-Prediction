Obesity has become a worldwide concern, especially over the past 33 years where [overweight and obesity rates among adults have increased by [27.5%](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/277450#Significantly-high-adult-obesity-increases-in-the-US). Rates among children and adolescents have increased even more by [47.1%](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/277450#Significantly-high-adult-obesity-increases-in-the-US). Excruciating circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic have fueled the situation, with [adult obesity prevalence jumping by [3%](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/july/adult-obesity-prevalence-increased-during-the-first-year-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20that%2C%20compared,of%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic) over the period from March 13, 2020 to March 18, 2021. What is more alarming is that the rate of Body Mass Index increase for children of ages 2 to 19 years nearly [doubled](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/children-obesity-COVID-19.html) during the pandemic. 

For this project, we analyze survey data from 479 Latin American undergraduate students to assess the lifestyle features congruent with obese & non-obese individuals. The [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+) was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. We attempted to create a tuned model for the purpose of predicting obesity through these features. Although the three models tested (Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and XGB Classifier) performed inadequately for implementation, information from this analysis can be used as a springboard for future data-driven models.
